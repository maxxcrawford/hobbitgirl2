              <h1>More ROTK Battle Scenes Info!</h1>
              <u>xoanon</u> @ 12:31 pm CST
              <p><strong>3rdOrcfromtheleft</strong> is back with more information on just what scenes they are filming at the studio backlots in Wellington. Take a look!</p>
              <p>Mostly our scenes consisted of Gondorians awaiting the Orc army to arrive at Minas Tirith, the battle then occuring with bows and arrows, a catapult, with the Orcs using the same as well as Nasgul arriving.</p>
              <p>Then we did the opposite, as Orcs lining up and marching to Minas Tirith; some of the battle - firing arrows, dodging CG rocks; the arrival of Aragorn and his ghost ships (all green screen); lastly, dead and dying Orcs and Rohans. </p>

              <u>xoanon</u> @ 1:44 am CST
              <p>I've just returned from a marathon 12 hour screening of Peter Jackson's FOTR: Special Edition. A handful of special quests (like one of the new writers for CHUD) attended the screening with Catherine and I. We viewed the entire special edition film and ALL 6 plus hours of the documentries and special features.</p>
              <p>I will be writing my full report tomorrow and will have it online by tomrrow night. Let me just tell you this, any fan of Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson, film making, film production, digital effects, sound effect production, and sound editing will NEED to have this DVD!!</p>
              <p>These DVD specials have the most complete, most thorough, behind the scenes, making of and special views I have ever seen on a DVD before. There is no aspect that is not covered, no detail left forgotten...everything you'll ever want to know about Fellowship....more tomorrow</p>

              <h1>LOTR Party On WB Lot</h1>
              <u>xoanon</u> @ 3:43 pm CST
              <p>Ringer Spy RobertoZombie sends along this bit of info on a LOTR party tonight on the Warners lot. This is no rumor, there will be a party tonight, I was in fact invited to it, but just exactly what it is for remains a mystery.</p>

              <p><em>I work at Warner Bros and I just walked by our theater here on the lot and the marquis says, "New Line Home Entertainment welcomes you to Middle Earth and the Lord of the Rings" and there are party fixings galore set up right out in front of the theater...</em></p>

              <p><em>Unfortunately, the party area is tented and blocked off with yellow tape, but I did spy a very hobbit-looking wheelbarrow right next to the tent entrance.</em></p>

              <p><em>Home Entertainment certainly indicated home video/DVD release, but it seems a bit early for an FOTR home video/DVD release party.</em></p>

              <p><em>I've made some phone calls and sent some e-mails (no responses yet) to try to find out WHAT and WHEN and WHO.</em></p>

              <p>Update: It seems that the party is in fact a press announcement on the LOTR:FOTR DVD details, such as release date, content and more.</p>
